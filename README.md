## Project guideline
Any public project SHOULD include:
* MIT License @ `LICENSE`
* Acknowledgement @ `README.md`
* BibTeX citation + link to PDF file @ `README`, if the project is accompanied with a research paper

Any public project SHOULD NOT include:
* Private data, undisclosed data, data with limited accessibility
  - Preferably, *any* data should be hosted outside of the repository.
* Personal information
  - *Unintended* personal information of researchers and developers within source code
  - Device IP address, password, secrets, file path, ...

Any Public project is encouraged to include:
* Project pages (GitHub pages or other platform)
* Examples as Colab/Jupyter notebook



## Dataset

* ECMWF ERA5 (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets)
* KMA Weather Data Service 'Open MET Data Portal' (https://data.kma.go.kr/data/sea/selectBuoyRltmList.do?pgmNo=52)
* Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries Data Service (http://wink.go.kr/main.do)

## Requirements

First, install PyTorch meeting your environment (at least 1.7):
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
```

Then, use the following command to install the rest of the libraries:
```bash
pip install tqdm ninja h5py kornia matplotlib pandas sklearn scipy seaborn wandb PyYaml click requests pyspng imageio-ffmpeg timm
```

## Features

- **Model:** A variant of the U-Net architecture based on Google DeepMind’s MetNet-2, designed to process continuous inputs (ocean surface wind components u and v, significant wave height (SWH), and mean wave period (MWP)), extract features through contraction–expansion pathways, and encode temporal information for time-series data processing.
